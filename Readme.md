***********************************************************************
   <b>This is a tabu search algorithm implementation for graph coloring</b>
***********************************************************************

Please read this before running the code

1. tabu.py -- contains my implementation
2. input directory contains all input files

Run instruction:
Please provide the input file name as the first argument during running like the following:

    >> python tabu.py <input_directory_path>input4.txt
    
The second argument is optional, it takes the number of iterations for tabu search. If it is not provided, the code will run with default (10000) iterations.

Output shows in the terminal. The 'Final result' section shows the output in the following manner:

line1:   #minimum color needed

line2:   #list of vertices with color number
